# TicTacToe_Game
## A Simple Tic-tac-Toe game for two players using Java Swing

The game works with a turn-based shift, it ends when 3 figures are
lined up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game can end even
if there's no more spot available and none of the three previous scenarios
could be achieved
